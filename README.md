### Description

Letâ€™s practice and become familiar with regressions


### Level 1

- Exercise 1: 
  - Create at least three different regression models to try to best predict DelayedFlights.csv flight delay (ArrDelay).

- Exercise 2: 
  - Compare them based on MSE and R2.

- Exercise 3: 
  - Train them using the different parameters they support

- Exercise 4: 
  - Compare your performance using the traint / test approach or using all data (internal validation)


### Level 2

- Exercise 5: 
  - Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction

### Level 3

- Exercise 6: 
  - Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions


### Targets

- Regression models
- Regression trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Other models
